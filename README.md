CanMan is a 2D Puzzle Platformer that pushes its players to traverse from level to level, completing movement related puzzles along the way. Whether it be with every resource at their disposal or as few resources as possible, players will find that there are numerous ways to complete each level's puzzles. Ultimately, it is up to the player to decide how they want to play!

## Installation
The file in this repository is an .exe file, otherwise known as an executable file, that goes through the install process of the game automatically. In other words, it is the game's installer. All you need to do is download the .exe file, run it, specify where you want the game to install, and continue the process. Please note that this game is designed to be ran on Windows 10, but should run on Windows 11 without an issue. 

## Getting Started
After installation, all you need to do is open the game and either select a level to play in "Level Select" or click "Play" to start from Level 1. To complete each level, simply make it to the door at the end. Completing each level will take you to the next level in the game's hierarchy (from 1 to 2 to 3, etc). From Level 1 onward, the game will teach you how to use its mechanics, so all you need to do from here is continue playing.
